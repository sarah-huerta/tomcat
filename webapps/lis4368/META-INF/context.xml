        Connection, Statement, ResultSet, etc. objects that haven't been closed

Notes:
suppress SSL warnings: useSSL="false"
driverClassName sometimes required. Also, note package naming convention:
"Top-down": general (com, org, net...) to more specific (project/product/lib name)
Prevents package name collisions.

New changes (for MySQL 8+ and JDBC driver):
changes driverClassName: driverClassName="com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver"
add to url property: &amp;allowPublicKeyRetrieval=true

Note: In XML documents, data values must be stored XML-entity encoded.
The & character is a special character (it denotes the start of an XML-entity),
and must be encoded to negate its special meaning.

So, a URL in the form
/page?useSSL=false&amp;allowPublicKeyRetrieval=true
stored inside an XML document is identical to the URL
/page?useSSL=false&allowPublicKeyRetrieval=true in an HTML5 document.

Note (remove EDT error): &amp;serverTimezone=UTC
