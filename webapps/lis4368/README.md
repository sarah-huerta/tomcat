- *NOTE:* *BEFORE* completing steps below, *BE CAREFUL* when doing so!
- *BE SURE* to compare file contents of *your* existing directories--if you have any--**BEFORE** overwriting. 
- Change *all* student_files directories to proper assignment name: For example, a1_student_files becomes a1.
- **Important!** context.xml (in META-INF) has changed since the videos were created. See comments in file.
- Lastly, include **your** main lis4368 README.md file here--do *NOT* create one on your remote Bitbucket site!
